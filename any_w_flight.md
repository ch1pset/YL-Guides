## Yl Any% W/ Flight Guide for PC

---

## Introduction:

>   This is an in-depth guide for Any% W/ Flight. For all newcommers to YL Speedrunning, we always recommend learning this run first as it is a great introduction to those wanting to speedrun YL. The route is very short, and you will most likely be able to finish a run in under 50 minutes without much practice. In this run, you will learn the basics of YL speedrunning, and the general route is essentially the same for the rest of the categories. The tricks in this route are used in most other categories.

## Hivory 1

### Shipwreck Creek:

+   Head straight over to Trowser and talk to him. He will teach you Tail Twirl.

>   *Pro-tip: The more direct your path is to Trowser, the faster you will reach him. Additionally, you can save up to 2 seconds by positioning YL the distance they stand from Trowser during the dialogue. This will eliminate the animation time it takes for YL to automatically position themselves from Trowser before the dialogue starts.*

>   

+   Immediately Tail Twirl the chest next to Trowser and collect the quill inside.
+   Perform Trowser Skip:
    +   [Method 1][insert_link_here]
    +   [Method 2][insert_link_here]
+   **Optional:** Grab Butterfly Booster
+   Perform [Quack Skip](insert_link_here)
+   Enter Hivory

### Hub A:

+   Upon entering Hivory Towers, you will need to talk to Trowser and collect your 1st Pagie by performing [Statue Climb](insert_link_here)

>   *Pro-tip: As soon as YL touches the pagie, you can QMM(quit-to-main-menu) and load back into the game. Since the only time we care about is loadless, the time spent on load screens is irrelevant.*
