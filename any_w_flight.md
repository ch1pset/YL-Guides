## Any% W/ Flight Guide[PC]

---

## Introduction:

>   This is an in-depth guide for Any% W/ Flight. For all newcommers to YL Speedrunning, we always recommend learning this run first as it is a great introduction to those wanting to speedrun YL. The route is very short, and you will most likely be able to finish a run in under 50 minutes without much practice. In this run, you will learn the basics of YL speedrunning, and the general route is essentially the same for the rest of the categories. The tricks in this route are used in most other categories.

## Hivory 1

|             | Pagies | Quills | Moves |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| **Section** | 5      | 1      | 3     |
| **Total**   | 5      | 1      | 3     |

### Shipwreck Creek 1:

+   Head straight over to Trowser and talk to him. He will teach you Tail Twirl. 

>   *Pro-tip: The more direct your path is to Trowser, the faster you will reach him. Additionally, you can save up to 2 seconds by positioning YL the distance they stand from Trowser during the dialogue. This will eliminate the animation time it takes for YL to automatically position themselves from Trowser before the dialogue starts.*

+   Immediately Tail Twirl the chest next to Trowser and collect the quill inside.
+   Perform Trowser Skip: 
    +   [Method 1](insert_link_here)
    +   [Method 2](insert_link_here)
+   ***Optional:*** Grab Butterfly Booster
+   Perform [Quack Skip](insert_link_here)
+   Enter Hivory

### Hub A 1:

+   Upon entering Hivory Towers, you will need to talk to Trowser and collect your 1st Pagie by performing [Statue Climb](insert_link_here)

>   *Pro-tip: As soon as YL touches the pagie, you can QMM(quit-to-main-menu) and load back into the game. Since the only time we care about is loadless, the time spent on load screens is irrelevant.*

+   Talk to Trowser to learn Reptile Roll
+   Perform [Early Waterworks Skip](insert_link_here)

>   *Pro-tip: Manual Camera will not get stuck on the wall when clipping OOB for EWW as long as you are running the latest version of YL on Steam. GOG version may vary. If you want to fix the camera on Classic mode, you will need to jump and air-attack as seen [here](insert_link_here).*

### Hub B 1:

+   You will enter Hub B in the Waterwroks area. Head straight to the Archive entrance.

>   *Pro-tip: You can save time traveling if you enter WW with [Quick-Rise](insert_link). You can also save time by doing [No-Splash-Jumping](insert_link) and even more time by performing [DerKO-Strat](insert_link)*

+   Collect Archive pagie by performing [Archive Clip](insert_link)

>   *Pro-tip: It doesn't hurt to attempt to [roll into](insert_link) the archive door on your first attempt at the clip. When attempting to clip through the archive door, you will want YL to be positioned about 2/3rds the way to the top of the door when you air-attack. Everyone has a unique method of clipping through the door with varying degrees of success.*

+   Exit Archive and equip Baller Tonic from Vendi next to Archive entrance.
+   Talk to Trowser to learn Glide
+   Collect [Tube Pagie](insert_link)
+   Collect Metal Slide Pagie by performing [Honeyless Metal Slide](insert_link)

##  Capital B

### Phase 1:

+   Use Super Slam to 2-cycle Phase 1

>   *Pro-tip: You can squeeze in an air-attack/tail-twirl after slamming on top of Cap B to ensure that you always 2-cycle.*

### Phase 2:

+   Hold R1 to Fix Camera during cutscene, it will aim towards Cap B
+   Roll to nearest box and use Slurp Shot
+   You must hit Capital B 15 times to advance to Phase 3

>   *Pro-tip: Aim at where Cap B is going to stop and shoot berries there. The further you are from Cap B, the more shots you can get in at one spot. The direction(clockwise or counter-clockwise) will be the direction Cap B will fly in Phase 4. You can exploit this for more favorable odds in Phase 4.*

### Phase 3:

+   Avoid Novas, use Super Slam to 1-cycle Cap B for every sub-phase

>   *Pro-tip: In sub-phase 2 and 4, you can roll around in [small circles](insert_link) to shake off the bees. You can also use [Ninpalk's-strat](insert_link) to be able to hit Cap B right away. Or you can just [YOLO](insert_link) it if you have enough health and confidence.*
>
>   *Warning: In sub-phase 2, you can still take damage from the bees in the cutscene after slamming Cap B.*

### Phase 4:

+   Sub Phase 1: Hit Cap B with 3 missiles, he will fire just 1 each time
+   Sub Phase 2: Hit Cap B with 3 missiles, he will fire 2 at a time

>   *Pro-tip: At this point, Cap B will begin flying clockwise or counter around the arena. Be careful with missile manipulation, Cap B will only take 1 damage if multiple hit him at once. Cap B also has a few [I-frames](insert_link) after firing the last missile, and does not take damage while firing missiles.*

+   Sub Phase 3: Hit Cap B with 1 missile, he will fire 3 at a time and speed up

>   *Pro-tip: Fly in the opposite direction of Cap B, you **cannot** catch-up to him by chasing him. Alternatively, you can [ride missiles](insert_link) and air-attack Cap B for the final hit. Or you can [super slam](insert_link) on top of him after he fires the last missile.*
