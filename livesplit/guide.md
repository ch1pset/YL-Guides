>   This guide will go over basics on how to use Live Split and customize it.

### Create a New Layout:

When you first launch live split, it will look like this:

![Live Split Basic](/images/live-split-basic.jpg)

Kind of dull. Let's fix that. Right-click anywhere on the live-split window and click on "Edit Layout":

![Edit Layout](/images/live-split-edit-layout.jpg)

This will bring up the Layout Editor:

![Layout Editor](/images/live-split-layout-editor.jpg)

Click the **+** button, then hover over *List* and select *Splits* and click *OK*:

![Add Splits](/images/add-list-splits.jpg)

### Create Splits:

Now right-click Live Split, and select *Edit Splits*(instead of Layout). This will bring up the Splits Editor:

![Splits Editor](/images/splits-editor.JPG)

Enter *Yooka-Laylee* as the Game Name, you will be able to select the game from a drop down menu as you type it. Click on the game name in the drop down so that you will have access to the *Auto Splitter*. You should see *Activate* become *Deactivate* and *Settings* become clickable. If not, click *Activate*.

Now you can begin adding splits by clicking *Insert Below/Above*. Split information is all optional, but you should name your splits after significant points of the run to help you remember the route, like these:

In the picture above, you'll notice some splits that are prefixed with (**-**) and others with 2 names, one in **{ }** and the other outside of them. These are only useable if you are using *Subsplits*, it allows you to subdivide segments into subsegments where the sum of all the subsegments are a full segment. It's useful for dividing up longer runs, but are not necessary.

Additionally, you can add icons by double clicking the empty *Icon* field for the segment. [Here](https://www.speedrun.com/tools/Split_Icons_cvh33.zip) are the icons for YL used in the above picture.

Click *OK* when you have finished adding segments.

### Adding RTA and IGT Timers:

Once again, right-click the Live Split window anywhere and select *Edit Layout*. Now we're going to add a *Timer*. You may use a *Detailed Timer* that will display additional information about each segment time, but for now we will just use a *Timer*. Double-click the new Timer and it will bring up this window:

![Timer Settings](/images/timer-settings.JPG)

Notice there are now 2 *Timer* tabs, and notice the *Timing Method* option. You will want to set one Timer to *Real Time* and the other to *Game Time*. Game Time is necessary for submitting any PC runs to SRC for YL.

Click *OK* when you are finished.

### Fixing Live Split Behavior:

Now right-click on Live Split and select *Settings*, you will get this window:

![Settings](/images/live-split-settings.JPG)

In order to use Live Split with YL, you will need to enable *Global Hotkeys* and *Double Tap Prevention* to avoid issues with timing.

### Happy Speedrunning!

That's pretty much it. This guide is very basic, I'm sure you can figure out the basic color customization on your own. I just wanted to cover the bare minimum needed for this game. Hope you enjoy speedrunning YL!
